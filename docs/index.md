# <b>Welcome to the Open FPGA Stack (OFS)</b>

<b>OFS is a software and hard infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload. 

The collection of OFS repository folders offer:</b>

1. Source-accessible RTL and software that can be modified fit your design goals.
2. Upstreamed Linux kernel drivers that provide management of your FPGA card.
3. Automated compilation scripts with compile switches to add or remove features
4. Userspace software tools that support:
    a. Remote update of your FPGA image
    b. Capability to run interface tests on your compiled design
    c. Discovery of card features and telemetry information
5. Unit tests available for key interface IP

To take advantage of the OFS infrastructure, you can start by evaluating the default OFS FPGA shell targeting Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Stratix 10<sup>&reg;</sup> FPGA provided with the GitHub release along with the OFS software stack.  After understanding what OFS has to offer you can leverage the repositories to begin your custom OFS FPGA design, workload or software application.
