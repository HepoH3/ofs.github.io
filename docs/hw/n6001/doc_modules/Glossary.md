|Accelerator Functional Unit	|AFU	|Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance. Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside. This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region.|

|Best Known Configuration	|BKC	|The software and hardware configuration Intel uses to verify the solution.|
|Board Management Controller|	BMC	|Supports features such as board power managment, flash management, configuration management, and board telemetry monitoring and protection. The majority of the BMC logic is in a separate component, such as an Intel Max10 or Intel Cyclone10 device; a small portion of the BMC known as the PMCI resides in the main Agilex FPGA.
|Configuration and Status Register	|CSR	|The generic name for a register space which is accessed in order to interface with the module it resides in (e.g. AFU, BMC, various sub-systems and modules).|
|Data Parallel C++	|DPC++|	DPC++ is Intel’s implementation of the SYCL standard. It supports additional attributes and language extensions which ensure DCP++ (SYCL) is efficiently implemented on Intel hardware.
|Device Feature List	|DFL	| The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration. This concept is the foundation for the OFS software framework.

|FPGA Interface Manager	|FIM|	Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs. The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring.|
|FPGA Management Engine	|FME	|Performs reconfiguration and other FPGA management functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME which is accessed through PF0.|
|Host Exerciser Module	|HEM	|Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc.|
|Input/Output Control|	IOCTL	|System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files.|
|Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O	|Intel VT-d	|Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization.|

|Memory Mapped Input/Output	|MMIO|	The memory space users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators.|
|oneAPI Accelerator Support Package	|oneAPI-asp	|A collection of hardware and software components that enable oneAPI kernel to communicate with oneAPI runtime and OFS shell components. oneAPI ASP hardware components and oneAPI kernel form the AFU region of a oneAPI system in OFS.|
|Open FPGA Stack	|OFS|	OFS is a software and hardware infrastructure providing an efficient approach to develop a custom FPGA-based platform or workload using an Intel, 3rd party, or custom board. |
|Open Programmable Acceleration Engine Software Development Kit|	OPAE-SDK|	The OPAE-SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space.|
|Platform Interface Manager	|PIM|	An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols.|
|Platform Level Data Model |PLDM|	A specification for reporting telemetry data to the host, such as board temperature, voltage, and current.|
|Platform Management Controller Interface|	PMCI|	The portion of the BMC that resides in the Agilex FPGA and allows the FPGA to communicate with the primary BMC component on the board.|
|Partial Reconfiguration	|PR	|The ability to dynamically reconfigure a portion of an FPGA while the remaining FPGA design continues to function. For OFS designs, the PR region is referred to as the pr_slot.|
|Port|	N/A	|When used in the context of the fpgainfo port command it represents the interfaces between the static FPGA fabric and the PR region containing the AFU.|
|Remote System Update|	RSU	|The process by which the host can remotely update images stored in flash through PCIe. This is done with the OPAE software command "fpgasupdate".|
|Secure Device Manager	|SDM|	The SDM is the point of entry to the FPGA for JTAG commands and interfaces, as well as for device configuration data (from flash, SD card, or through PCI Express* hard IP).|
|Static Region|	SR	|The portion of the FPGA design that cannot be dynamically reconfigured during run-time.|
|Single-Root Input-Output Virtualization|	SR-IOV	|Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance.|
|SYCL	|SYCL|	SYCL (pronounced "sickle") is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that enables code for heterogeneous and offload processors to be written using modern ISO C++ (at least C++ 17). It provides several features that make it well-suited for programming heterogeneous systems, allowing the same code to be used for CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs or any other hardware accelerator. SYCL was developed by the Khronos Group, a non-profit organization that develops open standards (including OpenCL) for graphics, compute, vision, and multimedia. SYCL is being used by a growing number of developers in a variety of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics.|
|Test Bench	|TB	|Testbench or Verification Environment is used to check the functional correctness of the Design Under Test (DUT) by generating and driving a predefined input sequence to a design, capturing the design output and comparing with-respect-to expected output.|
