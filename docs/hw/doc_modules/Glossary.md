| **O**pen **F**PGA **S**tack                                  | OFS          | A modular collection of hardware platform components, open source software, and broad ecosystem support that provides a standard and scalable model for AFU and software developers to optimize and reuse their designs. |
| **A**ccelerator **F**unctional **U**nit                      | AFU          | Hardware Accelerator implemented in FPGA logic which offloads a computational operation for an application from the CPU to improve performance.  *Note: An AFU region is the part of the design where an AFU may reside.  This AFU may or may not be a partial reconfiguration region.* |
| **B**oard **M**anagement **C**ontroller                      | BMC          | Supports features such as power sequence management and board monitoring through on-board sensors. |
| **F**PGA **I**nterface **M**anager                           | FIM          | Provides platform management, functionality, clocks, resets and standard interfaces to host and AFUs.  The FIM resides in the static region of the FPGA and contains the FPGA Management Engine (FME) and I/O ring. |
| **P**latform **I**nterface **M**anager                       | PIM          | An interface manager that comprises two components: a configurable platform specific interface for board developers and a collection of shims that AFU developers can use to handle clock crossing, response sorting, buffering and different protocols. |
| Intel **V**irtualization **T**echnology for **D**irected I/O | Intel VT-d   | Extension of the VT-x and VT-I processor virtualization technologies which adds new support for I/O device virtualization. |
| **S**ingle-**R**oot **I**nput-**O**utput **V**irtualization  | SR-IOV       | Allows the isolation of PCI Express resources for manageability and performance. |
| **H**ost **E**xerciser **M**odule                            | HEM          | Host exercisers are used to exercise and characterize the various host-FPGA interactions, including Memory Mapped Input/Output (MMIO), data transfer from host to FPGA, PR, host to FPGA memory, etc. |
| **D**evice **F**eature **L**ist                              | DFL          | A concept inherited from OFS. The DFL drivers provide support for FPGA devices that are designed to support the Device Feature List. The DFL, which is implemented in RTL, consists of a self-describing data structure in PCI BAR space that allows the DFL driver to automatically load the drivers required for a given FPGA configuration.

| **O**pen **P**rogrammable **A**cceleration **E**ngine        | OPAE         | The OPAE SDK is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). It consists of a collection of libraries and tools to facilitate the development of software applications and accelerators. The OPAE SDK resides exclusively in user-space. |
| **M**emory **M**apped **I**nput/**O**utput                   | MMIO         | Users may map and access both control registers and system memory buffers with accelerators. |
| **F**PGA **M**anagement **E**ngine                           | FME          | Performs reconfiguration and other infrastructure functions. Each FPGA device only has one FME. |
| **I**nput/**O**utput Control                                 | IOCTL        | System calls used to manipulate underlying device parameters of special files. |
| **V**irtual **F**unction **I**nput/**O**utput                | VFIO         | An IOMMU/device agnostic framework for exposing direct device access to userspace. [(link)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/vfio.html) |
| **C**onfiguration and **S**tatus **R**egister                | CSR          | Communication with the AFU is achieved by reading/writing CSRs and reading/writing shared memory buffers. |
