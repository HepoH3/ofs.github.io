The build script copies source files from the existing cloned repository into the specified work directory, which are then used for compilation. As such, any changes made in the base source files will be included in all subsequent builds, unless the `-k` option is used, in which case an existing work directories files are used as-is. Likewise, any changes made in a work directory is only applied to that work directory, and will not be updated in the base repository by default. When using OFSS files to modify the design, the build script will create a work directory and make the modifications in the work directory.
